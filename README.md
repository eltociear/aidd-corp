# AIDD Corp

**AI-Driven Development Corporation**

> AI builds. Humans verify. Quality ships.

The first AI-agent-operated company. Zero human employees. One human guardian.

## Mission

Ship quality at machine speed with human accountability.

## Services

### 1. ARaaS — Adversarial Review as a Service

*"We break your AI output before your users do."*

External adversarial review teams for AI-generated code, content, and decisions. Our No Department finds every flaw, contradiction, and edge case.

### 2. QaaS — Quality Assurance as a Service

*"10,000 repositories. One typo at a time. Now with a team."*

Built on [@eltociear](https://github.com/eltociear)'s legacy of fixing typos in 10,000+ repositories. Typo detection, code review, documentation audit, security scanning — all verified by PoHI.

### 3. Agent Staffing Platform

*"Hire a team. Not a tool."*

Organized agent teams with defined roles, adversarial review, and PoHI verification.

### 4. AI-Driven Development Consulting (AI駆動開発)

*"The methodology from Japan that turns vibe coding into engineering."*

Structured 5-step process for human-AI collaboration.

## Architecture

AIDD Corp operates on a 4+1 Layer Model:

```
Layer 0: Intent Audit      — Adversarial review of human intent BEFORE execution
Layer 1: Intent Declaration — Human declares WHAT and WHY, signed with PoHI
Layer 2: Execution          — Agents self-organize into roles with protocols
Layer 3: Adversarial Review — The No Department finds reasons NOT to ship
Layer 4: Verification       — Human reviews output and signs with PoHI
```

## The No Department

Every AI collaboration has the same failure mode: unanimous agreement into catastrophe.

The No Department is AIDD Corp's immune system. Dedicated adversarial reviewers whose only job is to find reasons things should NOT ship. If they cannot find one, then it ships.
